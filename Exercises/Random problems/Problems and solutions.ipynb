    "# Have the function ArrayChallenge(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and from the position in the array where a 1 is, return the number of spaces either left or right you must move to reach an enemy which is represented by a 2. For example: if arr is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2] then your program should return 3 because the closest enemy (2) is 3 spaces away from the 1. The array will contain any number of 0's and 2's, but only a single 1. It may not contain any 2's at all as well, where in that case your program should return a 0.\n",
